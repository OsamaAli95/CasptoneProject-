## This is the last course of the ibm data science professional certificate program 

In this capstone, we predicted if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertise Falcon 9  rockett
launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much 
of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, we tried to determine of the first stage will land
and hence, determine the cost of launch. 

In this project, we played the role of an alternate company called SpaceY that wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
